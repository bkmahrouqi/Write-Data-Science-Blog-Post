## Business Case Subject:
Exploring the Car Rental Industry.

## Introduction:
The car rental industry is an essential component of the global transportation market, offering short-term vehicle leasing solutions for both personal and business use. It provides a convenient alternative to car ownership, serving tourists, business travelers, and individuals requiring temporary access to vehicles.
From a business perspective, car rental companies are influenced by demand fluctuations tied to tourism, corporate travel, and urban mobility trends. Profitability is driven by rental fees, add-on services like insurance and GPS systems, and new subscription options. Success in this sector depends on efficient fleet management, strong customer service, and partnerships with travel aggregators.

## Project Objectives:
In this project, I will be investigating the following questions:
1-	Which cars are most rented based on their type, model, make and year?
2-	What are the top 5 states for car rentals?
3-	Who are the top 5 car owners?
4-	What are the distributions of the cars based on their fuel type? And which cars are getting more rented based on their fuel type?
5-	Which are the top 5 car types earning the most daily rates in each month throughout the year?
6-	Show the car ratings.

## Following the CRISP-DM Framework:
I will build my analysis based on the  Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. This framework covers the following 6 phases:
-	Business understanding
-	Data understanding
-	Data preparation
-	Modeling
-	Evaluation
-	Deployment/communication
